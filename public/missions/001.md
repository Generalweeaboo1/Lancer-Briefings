# Mission // #001
## Hammer and Lens
# Goals
- Stabilize the Situation for Union Enineers and Biospheres
- Secure landing zone for Union Engineers and Biosphere
  - Repel attacks until Company G arrives to relieve. 

# Stakes
- If we do not make a base of operations then this will set back the operation tremndously. Less troops for Kaldras IV to defend while the Pilots rebuild, then there will be less civllians to save. In addition, the biotech technology is worthwhile and very cost heavy to make as such it is imperative that you will protect these key conditions.

# Reserves
- A squad of Union Ground Troops will assist for one combat encounter as they are defending and safeguarding the engineers and biotech.
