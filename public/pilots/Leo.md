## Leonard Solari Observation Notes from the Grand Rose Duelist Academy
Out of all the most wonderful and blooming students we had in our academy we are proud to recommend Leonard Solari to your mission. He embodied everything that the school tries to exemplify. His style of combat is a wonderful bladework of his rapier combined with the deadliness of his pistolero skillsets. His ability to switch between each style seemlessly akin to a flower changing it's colors to the season.I will say out of everyone in the academy, his keen eyes able to research subjects of variety in great detail alongside his medical knowledge to help those in need is quite splendid to say the very least. His oratory skillset is something to behold as his theological rhetoric has been amplfied with by our training to use words poignot and sharper than any energy blade! I am happy to reccomend Leonard Solari as a teacher, and as a pilot.
