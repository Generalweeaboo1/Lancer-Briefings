# Ioulietta Estiechanteau Observation Notes from the Shadow Bladesmith Academy
Sir Estiechanteau is deadly and silent killing machine. We put him through many intense operations under many stress throughout his training in the academy. He has performed exceedingly well with his ability to remain stable and perform better udner pressure alongside of his ability to coerce and command inidivuals into what he may be asked. Throughout his training he has shown proficent in killing both as a pilot and with mechs. I would reccomend this student both in operative silent missions were stealth is key all the way to the brutish combat where you need someone to take out a low-point enemy. His ability to use a charged blade to deal incredible amount of damage in addition to his close combat capabilities has showcased how deadly he is. He has performed optimally and within paremeters of our academy and will be an asset to your missions.
